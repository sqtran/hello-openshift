# A Simple Webapp for OpenShift, JBoss EAP, and S2I Builds

This is a simple Web Archive (WAR) application to demonstrate deployments with OpenShift.

The application's root context is `/hello`

A curl-friendly hostname checker is available at `/hello/host`

It leverages several features from OpenShift's S2I build strategy, which allows images to be built directly from source code, using the base image `jboss-eap72-openshift:1.1` from Red Hat.  Their base image includes built-in scripting that allows several core EAP configurations to be dynamically configured at runtime.


## EAP Image Conventions

This project contains several folders not found in a typical `Maven` project.  The `jboss-eap72-openshift` automatically scans for and places contents of these folders into specific EAP locations.

- modules/* gets placed in $JBOSS_HOME/modules
- configuration/* copied to $JBOSS_HOME/standalone/configuration
- deployments/* copied to $JBOSS_HOME/standalone/deployments

Also note that `standalone-openshift.xml` replaces the default `standalone.xml` when running within OpenShift.  The OpenShift version is configured to do discovery and networking with OpenShift in mind, and probably won't work with other PaaS systems.


## Prerequisites

This application relies on having a database available.  Since we're running on OpenShift, I instantiated an ephemeral MariaDB database using the Kubernetes Template from the OpenShift Developer Catalog.  I used the SQL script `mariadb-sample.sql` to configure and populate the database with sample data.  You can use an existing database, but the values in the examples below will need to be adjusted accordingly.

To quick and dirty way to execute the `mariadb-sample.sql` script is to just open a terminal to the pod, and just copy and paste the SQL commands into that terminal.


## Configure Drivers Dynamically

A folder named `extensions` is provided that contains some `jboss-cli` scripts to dynamically configure JDBC Drivers for use with Datasources.

You can just run it via `oc` with the files provided in the extensions folder of this repo.

```bash
oc create configmap jboss-cli --from-file=postconfigure.sh=extensions/postconfigure.sh --from-file=extensions.cli=extensions/extensions.cli
```

And then add it to your `DeploymentConfig`.  Don't forget to change `hello-openshift` to the actual name of your `DeploymentConfig`.
```bash
oc set volume dc/hello-openshift --add --name=jboss-cli -m /opt/eap/extensions -t configmap --configmap-name=jboss-cli --default-mode='0755' --overwrite
```

There's nothing special about it, it just creates a `ConfigMap` with data that looks like this.  Look in the extensions folder to see for yourself.
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: jboss-cli
data:
  extensions.cli: |
    embed-server --std-out=echo  --server-config=standalone-openshift.xml
    /subsystem=datasources/jdbc-driver=mariadb:add(driver-name=mariadb,driver-module-name=org.mariadb,driver-xa-datasource-class-name=org.mariadb.jdbc.MariaDbDataSource,driver-class-name=org.mariadb.jdbc.Driver)
    quit
  postconfigure.sh: |
    #!/usr/bin/env bash
    set -x
    echo "Executing postconfigure.sh"
    $JBOSS_HOME/bin/jboss-cli.sh --file=$JBOSS_HOME/extensions/extensions.cli
```

When the pod restarts, you should see similar output at the top of the logs.

```bash
+ echo 'Executing postconfigure.sh'
Executing postconfigure.sh
+ /opt/eap/bin/jboss-cli.sh --file=/opt/eap/extensions/extensions.cli

```


## Configuring Datasources Dynamically

Here are two options for configuring datasources dynamically.

### Option 1: As Environment Variables

You can dynamcially create Datasources at runtime by injecting Environment variables into your `Deployment`/`DeploymentConfig`.  The settings can be added via single values (env), or as all values from a `ConfigMap` or `Secret`.

These are sample properties that a `ConfigMap` would need in order to configure a datasource.
```yaml
data:
  DB_SERVICE_PREFIX_MAPPING: example-mariadb=DS1
  DS1_DRIVER: mariadb
  DS1_JNDI: 'java:/example'
  DS1_URL: jdbc:mariadb://mariadb.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local:3306/test
  DS1_DATABASE: test
  DS1_USERNAME: user
  DS1_PASSWORD: password
  DS1_CONNECTION_CHECKER: org.jboss.jca.adapters.jdbc.extensions.mysql.MySQLValidConnectionChecker
  DS1_EXCEPTION_SORTER: org.jboss.jca.adapters.jdbc.extensions.mysql.MySQLExceptionSorter
  DS1_NONXA: "true"
  EXAMPLE_MARIADB_SERVICE_PORT: '3306'
  EXAMPLE_MARIADB_SERVICE_HOST: mariadb.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local
```

And here's a PostgreSQL example if you don't want to just use the default drivers.
```yaml
data:
  DB_SERVICE_PREFIX_MAPPING: example-psql=DS1
  DS1_DRIVER: postgresql
  DS1_JNDI: 'java:/example'
  DS1_URL: jdbc:postgresql://postgresql.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local:5432/test
  DS1_DATABASE: test
  DS1_USERNAME: user
  DS1_PASSWORD: password
  DS1_CONNECTION_CHECKER: org.jboss.jca.adapters.jdbc.extensions.mysql.MySQLValidConnectionChecker
  DS1_EXCEPTION_SORTER: org.jboss.jca.adapters.jdbc.extensions.mysql.MySQLExceptionSorter
  DS1_NONXA: "true"
  EXAMPLE_MARIADB_SERVICE_PORT: '5432'
  EXAMPLE_MARIADB_SERVICE_HOST: postgresql.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local
```
Note that you can only use one or the other.  Both examples are configured to use the same `java:/example` JNDI name, so you have to give them both unique names, or just use one of them.  The code is only looking for `java:/example`.

### Option 2: Projected Environment File(s) into a Volume

The implementation of this has some subtle differences.  Note the use of the `DATASOURCES` property, whereas the other method uses `DB_SERVICE_PREFIX_MAPPING` to create "short" names for the ENV properties.


These are sample properties that a `Secret` would need in order to configure a datasource.  Note the key is the name of the file, which is in properties file format, not `YAML`.

```properties
DATASOURCES=DS1
DS1_JNDI=java:/example
DS1_DRIVER=mariadb
DS1_USERNAME=user
DS1_PASSWORD=password
DS1_MAX_POOL_SIZE=20
DS1_MIN_POOL_SIZE=10
DS1_CONNECTION_CHECKER=org.jboss.jca.adapters.jdbc.extensions.mysql.MySQLValidConnectionChecker
DS1_EXCEPTION_SORTER=org.jboss.jca.adapters.jdbc.extensions.mysql.MySQLExceptionSorter
DS1_URL=jdbc:mariadb://mariadb.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local:3306/test
DS1_NONXA=true
```

**Note: For whatever reason, each line of my properties file started with two spaces when I cut and pasted.  Make sure you remove those spaces so everything is left-aligned.**


You'll need to project this `Secret` as a volume into your container.  The location doesn't really matter, but don't override any critical folders required for EAP to function properly.  I followed previous examples and projected it into `/etc/extensions`.

Finally, set the `ENV_FILES` ENV variable, which takes a comma-separated list if you projected your Datasources into multiple volumes.  If you have a single `Secret` that contains multiple files, you will need to list out all the files to be processed.


## Static Configurations

Everything I've demonstrated so far has been for dynamic configurations, but you'll also notice that I provided a `configuration/standalone-openshift.xml` file.  You can always statically configure EAP by passing in your own file.  The example configuration is the default `jboss-eap72-openshift:1.1`'s configuration file, so make sure you always use the latest version specific to your image.


## Best of Both Worlds
You can use both static and dynamic configuration methods to fine tune your EAP instance.  Pass in your own standalone-openshift.xml file and use ENV variables or custom jboss-cli scripts to configure EAP the way that you need it.

Note the placeholders throughout `standalone-openshift.xml` such as `<!-- ##DATASOURCES## -->` and `<!-- ##ELYTRON_KEY_STORE## -->`.  These are markers where the EAP base image inject calculated values, which are derived dynamically via built-in scripting.

## Dynamic standalone-openshift.xml with ENV variables

You can easily modify the existing `standalone-openshift.xml` with other runtime configurations with expression evalulations.  Through the configuration file, just reference an ENV variable with the `env.` prefix, and provide default values as needed.  This project has a sample setting for the logging level.  Set the ENV variable `CUSTOM_LOG_LEVEL` anywhere you choose to override the default value of INFO.  It would look like the following in the XML - `${env.CUSTOM_LOG_LEVEL:INFO}`.

Note that not all properties in the XML support expressions.  A field like the data-source `pool-name` needs a static name that cannot be configured at runtime.
